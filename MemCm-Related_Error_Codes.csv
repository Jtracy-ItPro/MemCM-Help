6719,6719,0x00001a3f,The object specified could not be created or opened because its associated TransactionManager is not online.  The TransactionManager must be brought fully Online by calling RecoverTransactionManager to recover to the end of its LogFile before objects in its Transaction or ResourceManager namespaces can be opened.  In addition errors in writing records to its LogFile can cause a TransactionManager to go offline.
6720,6720,0x00001a40,The specified TransactionManager was unable to create the objects contained in its logfile in the Ob namespace. Therefore the TransactionManager was unable to recover.
6721,6721,0x00001a41,The call to create a superior Enlistment on this Transaction object could not be completed because the Transaction object specified for the enlistment is a subordinate branch of the Transaction. Only the root of the Transaction can be enlisted on as a superior.

6723,6723,0x00001a43,The specified operation could not be performed on this Superior enlistment because the enlistment was not created with the corresponding completion response in the NotificationMask.
6724,6724,0x00001a44,The specified operation could not be performed because the record that would be logged was too long. This can occur because of two conditions: either there are too many Enlistments on this Transaction or the combined RecoveryInformation being logged on behalf of those Enlistments is too long.
6725,6725,0x00001a45,Implicit transaction are not supported.

6728,6728,0x00001a48,This snapshot operation cannot continue because a transactional resource manager cannot be frozen in its current state.  Please try again.
6729,6729,0x00001a49,The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.  In order to ensure correctness the ResourceManager must switch to a write-through mode and cease caching data within this transaction.  Enlisting for only subsequent transaction phases may still succeed.
6730,6730,0x00001a4a,The transaction does not have a superior enlistment.
6731,6731,0x00001a4b,The attempt to commit the Transaction completed but it is possible that some portion of the transaction tree did not commit successfully due to heuristics.

6809,6809,0x00001a99,The specified file miniversion was found but has been invalidated. Most likely cause is a transaction savepoint rollback.

6816,6816,0x00001aa0,There is no transaction metadata on the file.
6817,6817,0x00001aa1,The log data is corrupt.

6822,6822,0x00001aa6,The transactional resource manager has already been started.
6823,6823,0x00001aa7,The file cannot be opened transactionally because its identity depends on the outcome of an unresolved transaction.
6824,6824,0x00001aa8,The operation cannot be performed because another transaction is depending on the fact that this property will not change.
6825,6825,0x00001aa9,The operation would involve a single file with two transactional resource managers and is therefore not allowed.
6826,6826,0x00001aaa,The $Txf directory must be empty for this operation to succeed.

6838,6838,0x00001ab6,This file is open for modification in an unresolved transaction and may be opened for execute only by a transacted reader.
6839,6839,0x00001ab7,The request to thaw frozen transactions was ignored because transactions had not previously been frozen.

6847,6847,0x00001abf,The transactional resource manager cannot currently accept transacted work due to a transient condition such as low resources.
6848,6848,0x00001ac0,The transactional resource manager had too many tranactions outstanding that could not be aborted. The transactional resource manger has been shut down.

-2147018081,2147949215,0x80071a9f,The handle has been invalidated by a transaction. The most likely cause is the presence of memory mapping on a file or an open handle when the transaction ended or rolled back to savepoint.

-2147018072,2147949224,0x80071aa8,The operation cannot be performed because another transaction is depending on the fact that this property will not change.
-2147018071,2147949225,0x80071aa9,The operation would involve a single file with two transactional resource managers and is therefore not allowed.

-2147018069,2147949227,0x80071aab,The operation would leave a transactional resource manager in an inconsistent state and is therefore not allowed.
